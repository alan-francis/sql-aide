# SQLa Polygenix Engine

The `SQLa` _Polygenix_ module is a library that can *gen*erate polyglot
(multiple languages) source code. **Polygenix** is the proper name of the
library but it can be seen in its shorter, easier to pronounce, form as
**polygen**.

Polygenix can generate:

- [x] Rust `serde` library annotated structs (e.g. for `Rusqlite`)
- [ ] Rust `SeaORM` or `Diesel` library annotated structs
- [ ] Other non-Rust libraries coming soon
