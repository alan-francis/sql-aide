title: Microsoft Excel-first UX

# Microsoft Excel-first UX but client-independent

Microsoft Excel should be the first UI that all data access should be designed
for when accessing outside of developer-centric PgDCP use cases. If Excel can
properly show your data, in a safe, secure, and performant way, then every other
client can also do so. Excel-first UX should target "live ODBC" use cases where
the database is directly accessed using PostgreSQL binary protocol.
