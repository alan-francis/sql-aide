# Installation

SQLa (SQL Aide) is designed to be lightweight and easily accessible, with no
need for local installations or dependencies other than Deno, a secure runtime
for JavaScript and TypeScript. With Deno's unique single-binary deployment model
and use of web-friendly URLs which allow your code and templates to reside
anywhere, you can quickly import and use SQLa in your projects by adding just a
few lines of code.

Here's how to install and import SQLa using Deno:

<Steps>
### Install Deno (single binary)

If you haven't already, install Deno by following the instructions specific to
your operating system. Visit the Deno website (https://deno.land/) for installation
guidelines.

### Import SQLa (locally or remotely from URL)

In your project, create a new Typescript file (e.g., index.ts) or use an existing
one. Open the file in your preferred code editor. Import SQLa using the Deno
module specifier: Import SQLa by adding the following line of code at the top
of your file:

```typescript
import * as SQLa from "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/netspective-labs/sql-aide/vX.Y.Z/mod.ts";
```

Replace `vX.Y.Z` with the version number or just `main` if you want the latest
version (pinning versions is highly recommended, though). This line of code
imports the SQLa module from the remote source, making all its functionality
available for use in your project.

### Start building your database models

With SQLa imported, you can start utilizing its features to generate SQL
statements, define database schemas, and more. Refer to the SQLa documentation
and examples to explore the available functionality and unleash the power of
SQLa in your project.
</Steps>

By leveraging Deno's unique deployment model, SQLa eliminates the need for local
installations and dependencies, making it incredibly lightweight and accessible.
With just a few lines of code, you can import SQLa remotely and take advantage
of its robust SQL generation capabilities in any Deno project.

Note: When running your project, make sure to use the deno run command with the
appropriate flags to enable network access for the remote module import. For
example:

```bash
deno run --allow-net index.ts
```

The `--allow-net` flag grants permission to make network requests and allows
Deno to fetch the SQLa module remotely.

If you want to make your scripts easily executable, just include the _shebang_
line at the top of your scripts and set the executable bit on the file:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env -S deno run --allow-all
import * as SQLa from "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/netspective-labs/sql-aide/v1.0.0/mod.ts";
```

With SQLa installed and imported, you're ready to harness the power of SQL
generation and simplify your database interactions using the lightweight and
accessible nature of SQLa with Deno.
