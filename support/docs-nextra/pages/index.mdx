# SQL Aide (SQLa) Typescript library optimized for emitting and packaging SQL

Welcome to SQLa (SQL Aide), an innovative SQL generation library designed to
simplify the process of generating SQL statements in Typescript and beyond. SQLa
combines the power of Typescript and SQL templates to provide a comprehensive
solution for generating SQL code compatible with multiple database systems.

SQLa takes inspiration from the concept of static site generators and applies it
to SQL-heavy applications and services. It leverages the capabilities of
JavaScript functions and
[Template literals (Template strings)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals)
to prepare SQL components as composable building blocks, known as "SQL
partials." These partials serve as the fundamental units for constructing SQL
files and other database artifacts.

The goal of SQLa is to assist in the preparation, organization, assembly,
loading, and revision management of type-safe and deterministically reproducible
SQL code. It eliminates the need for introducing a separate template language by
utilizing a set of naming conventions and harnessing the full power of
JavaScript (and TypeScript) template strings.

With SQLa, you can leverage JavaScript's dynamic and expressive nature to
prepare the final SQL statements that will be assembled and loaded into your
relational databases. This approach allows for a flexible and efficient way of
generating SQL code, while ensuring type safety and reproducibility.

By adopting SQLa, you can benefit from:

- **Code Reusability**: SQLa promotes the creation of reusable SQL partials,
  enabling you to encapsulate common SQL components and efficiently build SQL
  statements for various scenarios.

- **Type Safety**: With the integration of TypeScript, SQLa ensures type safety
  throughout the SQL generation process. You can catch errors and enforce data
  type consistency at compile-time, reducing the likelihood of runtime issues.

- **Deterministic Reproducibility**: SQLa facilitates the creation of SQL code
  that is consistently reproducible. This characteristic is crucial when working
  with data pipelines and processes that require predictable and repeatable
  results.

- **Expressive SQL Generation**: Leveraging JavaScript (and TypeScript) template
  strings, SQLa allows for the full power and expressiveness of the language.
  You can incorporate dynamic logic, conditional statements, loops, and other
  programming constructs seamlessly into your SQL templates.

- **Database Agnosticism**: SQLa provides support for multiple SQL dialects,
  allowing you to generate SQL code that is compatible with various database
  systems. This flexibility enables you to work with different databases without
  significant modifications to your codebase.

With SQLa, you can streamline your SQL generation workflow, enhance code
maintainability, and improve the overall development experience when working
with SQL-heavy applications and services.

## Key Features

- **Typesafe Schema Definition**: SQLa seamlessly integrates with the Zod
  library, enabling you to define database schemas in a Typesafe manner within
  your Typescript code. By leveraging Typescript's static typing, SQLa catches
  errors early in the development process, ensuring the correctness of your SQL
  code and enhancing developer productivity.
- **SQL Generation in Typescript, JavaScript, and via CLI**: SQLa offers a
  command-line interface (CLI) that generates SQL templates, making it versatile
  beyond Typescript code. You can use the CLI to generate templates for tables,
  columns, views, stored procedures, and stored functions. This capability
  allows for easier management and organization of your SQL code, even outside
  of a Typescript codebase.
- **Multi-Dialect SQL Generation**: SQLa provides a unified interface to
  generate SQL statements compatible with different SQL dialects. Whether you're
  working with MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, or other popular database systems,
  SQLa allows you to generate SQL code that adheres to the specific requirements
  of each target database.
- **PostgreSQL psql Meta Commands Subset**: SQLa supports a subset of PostgreSQL
  psql meta commands, enabling you to write simple SQL templates that utilize
  these commands. Regardless of the target database, you can employ these
  commands to handle common SQL tasks efficiently, such as importing data,
  executing scripts, or managing database connections.
- **Full Power of Typescript and Javascript**: For advanced SQL templates, SQLa
  empowers you to leverage the full power of Typescript and Javascript string
  template literals. This flexibility enables you to incorporate dynamic logic,
  conditional statements, loops, and other programming constructs into your SQL
  templates. Consequently, you can generate complex and customized SQL code
  tailored to the specific requirements of your application.

## Supported SQL Dialects

SQLa supports a wide range of SQL dialects, including but not limited to:

- PostgreSQL
- SQLite
- Microsoft SQL Server
- DuckDB
- MySQL, Dolt (coming soon, looking for contributors)
- Oracle Database (coming soon, looking for contributors)

This allows you to write database-agnostic code using SQLa and effortlessly
switch between different database systems without extensive modifications to
your codebase.

Whether you're a Typescript developer seeking type-safe SQL generation or
someone working with SQL templates outside of a Typescript project, SQLa
provides a comprehensive solution. The following sections of this documentation
will guide you through the installation process, CLI usage, SQL template
generation, and advanced features of SQLa. By using SQLa, you can streamline
your SQL code generation workflow and enhance your development experience.

`SQLa` was initially created for [PostgreSQL Data Computing Platform (PgDCP)](dcp)-based
apps and services but is beneficial in other SQL-centric use cases for non-PostgreSQL-based
databases.
