# SQL Aide (SQLa) Typescript library optimized for emitting and packaging SQL

SQL Aide (`SQLa`) is a suite of Deno TypeScript modules which use the power of
JavaScript functions and
[Template literals (Template strings)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals)
to prepare SQL components as composable building blocks ("SQL partials"). `SQLa`
is like a static site generator but instead of generating HTML, it generates SQL
files and other database artifacts for SQL-heavy apps and services.

`SQLa` targets services or applications that must assemble and load SQL into in
a deterministically reproducible manner. `SQLa` is an _aide_ which helps
prepare, organize, assemble, load, and revision manage type-safe,
_deterministically reproducible_, SQL code.

Instead of inventing yet another template language, `SQLa` uses a set of naming
conventions plus the full power of JavaScript (and TypeScript) template strings
to prepare the final SQL that will be assembled and loaded into (mostly)
relational databases.

`SQLa` was initially created for [PostgreSQL Data Computing Platform (PgDCP)](dcp)-based
apps and services but is beneficial in other SQL-centric use cases for non-PostgreSQL-based
databases.
