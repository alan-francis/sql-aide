Welcome to SQLa (SQL Aide), an innovative SQL generation library designed to
simplify the process of generating SQL statements in Typescript and beyond. SQLa
uses the power of [Template literals (Template strings)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals).

SQLa is like a "[static site generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator)"
for SQL and related database artifacts, allowing you to efficiently prepare,
organize, and assemble SQL code and other database source code components.
Similar to how a static site generator simplifies the process of creating static
websites, SQLa streamlines the generation of SQL statements and related
artifacts for SQL-heavy applications and services.

By preparing relational tables, columns, views, stored procedures, and stored
functions in TypeScript using SQLa's intuitive syntax and the Zod library,
you can ensure consistency and reliability in your SQL and application source
code generation workflow.

Just like a static site generator allows you to define templates and content
that get transformed into static web pages, SQLa enables you to define templates
and schemas that get transformed into SQL statements and other database
artifacts that you can pull into your apps and services as libraries. It
provides a structured approach to SQL generation, allowing you to compose SQL
code in a consistent and maintainable manner.

SQLa leverages the capabilities of JavaScript functions and
[Template literals (Template strings)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals)
to prepare SQL components as composable building blocks, known as "SQL
partials." It eliminates the need for introducing a separate template language
by utilizing a set of naming conventions and harnessing the full power of
JavaScript (and TypeScript) template strings. These _partials_ serve as the
fundamental units for constructing SQL files and other database artifacts.

By adopting SQLa, you can benefit from:

- **Code Reusability**: SQLa promotes the creation of reusable SQL partials,
  enabling you to encapsulate common SQL components and efficiently build SQL
  statements for various scenarios.

- **Type Safety**: With the integration of TypeScript, SQLa ensures type safety
  throughout the SQL generation process. You can catch errors and enforce data
  type consistency at compile-time, reducing the likelihood of runtime issues.

- **Deterministic Reproducibility**: SQLa facilitates the creation of SQL code
  that is consistently reproducible. This characteristic is crucial when working
  with data pipelines and processes that require predictable and repeatable
  results.

- **Expressive SQL Generation**: Leveraging JavaScript (and TypeScript) template
  strings, SQLa allows for the full power and expressiveness of the language.
  You can incorporate dynamic logic, conditional statements, loops, and other
  programming constructs seamlessly into your SQL templates.

- **Database Agnosticism**: SQLa provides support for multiple SQL dialects,
  allowing you to generate SQL code that is compatible with various database
  systems. This flexibility enables you to work with different databases without
  significant modifications to your codebase.

With SQLa, you can streamline your SQL generation workflow, enhance code
maintainability, and improve the overall development experience when working
with SQL-heavy applications and services.

## Key Features

  library, enabling you to define database schemas in a Typesafe manner within
  your Typescript code. By leveraging Typescript's static typing, SQLa catches
  errors early in the development process, ensuring the correctness of your SQL
  code and enhancing developer productivity.
- **SQL Generation in Typescript, JavaScript, and via CLI**: SQLa offers a
  command-line interface (CLI) that generates SQL templates, making it versatile
  beyond Typescript code. You can use the CLI to generate templates for tables,
  columns, views, stored procedures, and stored functions. This capability
  allows for easier management and organization of your SQL code, even outside
  of a Typescript codebase.
- **App/Service Source Code Generation for any Language**: SQLa can go beyond
  SQL to generate a wide range of artifacts that support your database-related
  workflows such as ORM specifications, database documentation, schema migration,
  etc. from a single "source of truth".
- **Multi-Dialect SQL Generation**: SQLa provides a unified interface to
  generate SQL statements compatible with different SQL dialects. Whether you're
  working with MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, or other popular database systems,
  SQLa allows you to generate SQL code that adheres to the specific requirements
  of each target database.
- **PostgreSQL psql Meta Commands Subset**: SQLa supports a subset of PostgreSQL
  psql meta commands, enabling you to write simple SQL templates that utilize
  these commands. Regardless of the target database, you can employ these
  commands to handle common SQL tasks efficiently, such as importing data,
  executing scripts, or managing database connections.
- **Full Power of Typescript and Javascript**: For advanced SQL templates, SQLa
  empowers you to leverage the full power of Typescript and Javascript string
  template literals. This flexibility enables you to incorporate dynamic logic,
  conditional statements, loops, and other programming constructs into your SQL
  templates. Consequently, you can generate complex and customized SQL code
  tailored to the specific requirements of your application.

## Supported SQL Dialects

SQLa supports a wide range of SQL dialects, including but not limited to:

- PostgreSQL
- SQLite
- Microsoft SQL Server
- DuckDB
- Clickhouse
- MySQL, Dolt (coming soon, looking for contributors)
- Oracle Database (coming soon, looking for contributors)

This allows you to write database-agnostic code using SQLa and effortlessly
switch between different database systems without extensive modifications to
your codebase.

Whether you're a Typescript developer seeking type-safe SQL generation or
someone working with SQL templates outside of a Typescript project, SQLa
provides a comprehensive solution. The following sections of this documentation
will guide you through the installation process, CLI usage, SQL template
generation, and advanced features of SQLa. By using SQLa, you can streamline
your SQL code generation workflow and enhance your development experience.

:::note
`SQLa` was initially created for [PostgreSQL Data Computing Platform (PgDCP)](dcp)-based
apps and services but is beneficial in other SQL-centric use cases for non-PostgreSQL-based
databases.
