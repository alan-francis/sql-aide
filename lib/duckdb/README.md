# DuckDB shell / CLI wrapper

As an embedded database DuckDB doesn't really have the concept of procedural
languages so this Deno Typescript module provides a library that allows you to
call the `duckdb` shell command.

## TODO

- See the `../sqlite` module and integrate some of those capabilities if
  helpful.
