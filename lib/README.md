# SQL Aide (SQLa) - `lib` Directory

The `lib` directory in SQL Aide (SQLa) serves as a versatile monorepo for code
that offers functionality used throughout various parts of SQLa, including the
`pattern` and `render` directories. However, it's essential to understand that
all the code contained within the `lib` directory is crafted with high
reusability in mind, and it is not coupled to SQLa. This means that you can
effortlessly leverage the code found here in other TypeScript runtimes,
services, or applications that require similar functionality.

## Code Reusability

The primary objective of the `lib` directory is to provide a repository of
reusable TypeScript code that extends beyond SQL-specific operations. This code
is engineered to be modular, well-documented, and adaptable, making it suitable
for integration into various TypeScript projects, even those unrelated to SQL or
SQLa.

**There should never be any SQL-specific or SQLa-specific code in `lib`,
SQLa-specific code belongs in `render` and `pattern`.**

## Use Cases

The `lib` directory encompasses a diverse set of code modules and utilities that
can be beneficial in a wide range of scenarios, including, but not limited to:

1. **General TypeScript Projects:** The code in `lib` is not limited to
   SQL-related tasks. It includes utility functions, data structures, and
   abstractions that can enhance the development of any TypeScript project.

2. **Deno Applications:** If you are working with Deno, the code in the `lib`
   directory is designed to be Deno-compatible. You can effortlessly import and
   use these modules in your Deno applications.

3. **Backend Services:** Whether you are building REST APIs, WebSocket servers,
   or any backend service, the `lib` directory provides valuable building blocks
   that can save you time and effort.

4. **Frontend Applications:** Some components of the `lib` directory, such as
   data validation or formatting functions, may find utility in frontend
   applications as well.

## Benefits

By incorporating code from the `lib` directory into your projects, you can
benefit from:

- **Code Reusability:** Avoid reinventing the wheel by reusing battle-tested
  code modules for common tasks.
- **Modularity:** Leverage individual modules as needed, promoting clean and
  maintainable code.
- **Community-Driven Development:** The code in `lib` is maintained by the SQLa
  community and follows best practices, ensuring quality and reliability.
- **Compatibility:** Code in the `lib` directory is designed to work with a wide
  range of TypeScript and Deno environments.
